* Floyd-Warshall Algorithm for All Pairs Shortest Paths
    - graph
    - The problem is to find the shortest distances between every pair of vertices in a given edge-weighted directed Graph. 
* Bellman-Ford Algorithm for Single-Source Shortest Paths
    - graph
    - Given a graph and a source vertex src in the graph, find the shortest paths from src to all vertices in the given graph. The graph may contain negative weight edges. 
* Kruskal's Algorithm for Minimum Spanning Tree
    - graph
    - Kruskal's algorithm is a minimum spanning tree algorithm that takes a graph as input and finds the subset of the edges of that graph. This input forms a tree that includes every vertex, where the total weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized.

* Union-Find (Disjoint Set) Data Structure 
    - graph
    - In computer science, a disjoint-set data structure, also called a union–find data structure or merge–find set, is a data structure that stores a collection of disjoint (non-overlapping) sets.

* Knapsack Problem (0/1 and Unbounded)
    - DP
    - In the knapsack problem, you need to pack a set of items, with given values and sizes (such as weights or volumes), into a container with a maximum capacity . If the total size of the items exceeds the capacity, you can't pack them all.
* Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) 
    - DP
    - The longest common subsequence (LCS) is defined as the longest subsequence that is common to all the given sequences, provided that the elements of the subsequence are not required to occupy consecutive positions within the original sequences.

* Bipartite Matching (Hopcroft-Karp Algorithm)
    - matching
    - A matching in a Bipartite Graph is a set of the edges chosen in such a way that no two edges share an endpoint. A maximum matching is a matching of maximum size (maximum number of edges). In a maximum matching, if any edge is added to it, it is no longer a matching. There can be more than one maximum matchings for a given Bipartite Graph. 
    - There are M job applicants and N jobs. Each applicant has a subset of jobs that he/she is interested in. Each job opening can only accept one applicant and a job applicant can be appointed for only one job. Find an assignment of jobs to applicants in such that as many applicants as possible get jobs.`
